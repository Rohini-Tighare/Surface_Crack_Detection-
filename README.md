# Surface_Crack_Detection-
A Surface Crack Detection CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model is a type of artificial neural network designed to identify and localize surface cracks on objects or structures. This is commonly used in applications like quality control in manufacturing or infrastructure inspections.
Accurately identify and classify cracks on various surfaces like Buildings , Roads ,Infrastructure. This model aims to automate the process of crack detection, enabling early identification and inventions to prevent further Damage .
Achieved Accuracy of 93.15%
